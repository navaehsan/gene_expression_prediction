# prediction of gene expression
predicting gene expression using allelic fold change


# aFC_Whole_Blood.txt
This is a tab delimited file providing allelic fold change for each eQTL. In this file for each variant in columnn "variant_id" we have the following information:

gene_id : gene associated to that variant

rank : rank of that variant in eQTL calling process

CHROM : the chromosome of the variant

POS : position of that variant

REF : The Reference allele

ALT : The Alternative allele

log2_aFC : The effect size of the variant
