predicting gene expression using allelic fold change


# AFC_Whole_Blood.txt
In this file for each variant in columnn "variant_id" we have the following information:
gene_id : gene associated to that variant
rank : rank of that variant in eQTL calling process
CHROM : the chromosome of the variant
POS : position of that variant
REF : The Reference allele
ALT : The Alternative allele
log2_aFC : The effect size of the variant
